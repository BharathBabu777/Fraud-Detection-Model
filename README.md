# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project involves building a robust fraud detection model using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset with several features, including transaction details and account balances.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 99.96% on the test data and 99.99% on the training data. It uses several features such as transaction details like the amount, type, and step (time), as well as account details like old and new balances for both the originator and recipient accounts.

## Key Features

- Robust fraud detection model using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm.
- Effective handling of outliers in the data to improve the model's performance.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score metrics.
- Generation of a confusion matrix to understand the model's prediction capabilities.
